# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, if it exists
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront.

## File structure

This repo uses the single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md                # optional repo-wide domain glossary and language
├── docs/adr/                 # architecture and decision records
├── server/
├── client/
└── README.md
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, or a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md` if it exists. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007, but worth reopening because…_
